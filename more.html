            <h2>About<span> Me</span></h2>
            <h4>Hello! My name is Selin Ivana Christin...</h4>
            <p>I am currently a 6th-semester student majoring in Information Systems at Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta with GPA 3.73. Throughout my academic journey, I have actively participated in various organizations and committees, enhancing my leadership and teamwork skills. I am a member of the Social Community Division in the Information Systems Student Association, a dancer in Komstar, which focuses on traditional dance, and I also serve as the secretary for ACDC, a modern dance club. Additionally, I am involved in Formasi, a community for Bidikmisi scholarship students, where I am part of the Talent and Interests Division.
                <br>
                <br>I have also gained valuable experience through my involvement in several event committees. I was a committee member for the university's PKKMB orientation program, the coordinator for Indonesia's Independence Day celebration in Pereng Dawe village, and a committee member for Soundwave, our campus music festival.
                <br>
                <br>In terms of work experience, I have worked as a Frontliner at Super Dazzle for two months (January 2022 - February 2022) and as a Mobile Phone Promoter at Super Dazzle for one and a half years (January 2023 - June 2024).
                <br>
                <br>I have a keen interest in the world of business and technology, aligning perfectly with my field of study. I am passionate about exploring new opportunities and challenges that will allow me to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world scenarios.
